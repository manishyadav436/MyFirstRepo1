			<dl>
				<dt>1)&nbsp<u>Free Shipping On Orders OverRs 40,000:</u></dt>
				  <dd>SPOT INDIA GROUP Wholesale Point is pleased to pass down its Shipping discounts by offering FREE GROUND SHIPPING for Non-Freight orders depending on what PIN code the order is shipped to. The closer you are to our warehouse in Navi Mumbai or New Delhi, the lower your free shipping limit will be. We hope this site wide promotion will encourage you to browse through our ever growing variety of products and see how we can further meet your needs. Please keep in mind that the customer may be responsible for paying the actual shipping cost of returned orders which received the free shipping promotion.</dd>
				
				<dt>2)&nbsp<u>Free Shipping On Individual Items: </u></dt>
				  <dd>SPOT INDIA GROUP provides free shipping on many individual items despite the order amount (when there is no mention of "on qualified orders"). However, if an item that does not include Free Shipping is added to the order, and the order is Rs 40,000 and below, that item alone will incur the appropriate shipping charge</dd>
			</dl>
			 
			 
			* Unfortunately, we are currently unable to extend any Free Shipping promotions to customers shipping orders outside the 29 states. If you are shipping outside of this area normal shipping rates appl	y.

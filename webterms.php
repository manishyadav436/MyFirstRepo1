  Our company is dedicated to you, our customer! We want you to buy with confidence anytime you purchase products on Westside Wholesale.com. We guarantee a simple shopping experience by combining competitive pricing, product availability, excellent customer service, quick shipping, and after sale support and care. Westside Wholesale, Inc. is an Authorized Distributor for products listed throughout the website.

Additionally we believe in giving our customers the best pricing possible.
All of our listed products are in Brand New Condition and come with a Full Manufacturer’s Warranty. Be aware that there are a great number of websites and individuals on the internet that sell products which are “grey market”, obtained through liquidation, knock-off reproduction or through other channels that are not authorized by the manufacturer’s distribution. Even though the item may be advertised as containing a manufacturer’s warranty, quite often the warranty is void because it is not sold through an authorized distributor. Rest assured that all of the products sold by Westside Wholesale are NOT Refurbished, Used, nor Generic.
We provide phone support, offer Free Ground Shipping for all orders over Rs 40,000 ensure products are properly packaged and keep customers informed of all stages of their order from start to finish.
